# Example configuration for grid generation with country polygon filtering
# This configuration generates a grid of points, but only includes points
# that fall within a specific country's boundary

# Grid configuration with country filter
grid:
  # Bounding box: [minx, miny, maxx, maxy] in degrees (longitude, latitude)
  # OPTIONAL when using country polygon - bbox will be automatically calculated from the polygon
  # This ensures all islands and territories are included
  # If provided, it will be overridden by the polygon's bbox
  # bbox: [-5.0, 41.0, 9.0, 51.0]  # Optional - not needed when using country polygon
  
  # Spacing between grid points in degrees
  # 0.1 degrees ≈ 11 km at equator
  spacing: 0.1
  
  # Starting ID for generated points (optional, default: 0)
  start_id: 0
  
  # Label for all generated points (optional, default: 0)
  start_label: 0
  
  # Incremental processing: process points one by one
  incremental: true
  
  # Country polygon filtering - only points within country will be generated
  country_polygon_path: "data/countries.shp"  # Path to your country polygon shapefile
  country_filter_column: "NAME"  # Column name (common options: "NAME", "ISO_A3", "ISO_A2", "NAME_EN")
  country_filter_value: "France"  # Country name or code to filter by

# Alternative: Filter by ISO code instead of name
# grid:
#   spacing: 0.1
#   incremental: true
#   country_polygon_path: "data/countries.shp"
#   country_filter_column: "ISO_A3"  # ISO 3-letter code
#   country_filter_value: "FRA"  # France ISO code
#   # bbox is automatically calculated from the polygon

# Multiple modalities configuration
modalities:
  - name: "google_maps"
    type: "tms"
    bbox_size: 0.025749  # Size in degrees (for 4800x4800 pixels at zoom 18)
    zoom_level: 18
    tile_server: "google"

# Global output configuration
output:
  format: "tif"
  dir: "output"
  crs: "EPSG:4326"
  compress: "lzw"
